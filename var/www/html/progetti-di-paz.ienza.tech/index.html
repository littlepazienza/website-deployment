          Hey, Dad,<br>
          I've been trying to think of something to get you for your 60th. Trying didn't last long, I gave up after one trip downtown where I passed leather shops, cafes, fancy stationary stores, a store that's called "The Nut Shop" which just sells a bunch of nuts, fancy watch stores (that may have been cool), a suit place or two, you get the point. Nothing felt special enough for a 60th birthday. Its already hard enough to shop for you old timer. My whole life you have done everything you could for me and expected nothing in return. Thinking back to your past presents, I did give you, socks, sweaters, jerseys (I know that newcastle jersey was one of your favorites), slow cooked meat shredders shaped like wolverine's claws, whatever the hell else I am forgetting. None of those gifts ever seemed to matter to you as much as it did to see me thriving, see me happy, see me being myself and growing up strong and healthy and actually being a decent enough guy. So if all of those gifts fell short then how the hell am I supposed to know what to get you when I actually feel like enough is enough, you deserve the world in return and all I can think to get you within a reasonable budget is a watch or airpods or a suit. I only have a few decades left with you pops, I want us to make them count. I really do. Well im pretty good at writing, and listening to my emotions (albiet poorly or recklessly most of the time), something I have noticed you seem to have more of a focus on lately, so step one is this letter, from the heart. I hope you like it. Idk where I get it from but you can tell me sometime if you secretly are a letter writing savant. So this is just the introduction, strap in. I thought of a good gift. Here it is. The letter is the beginning as I just mentioned, but this letter represents what I'd like my gift to you today to be, and its a gift that keeps giving, which is definitely the best gift to give you since you'd "love" a watch but wear it fucking once or twice between now and when you turn 70 lol. My gift to you dad is a webpage. Its a project space for you to have a good time soaking up the slow meticulous process of being one of the most precise, intentional, and calm men I have ever met. I want you to use this project space to share the love you have for woodworking with the rest of us, its a place we can collaborate on projects for / with each other, an example being Katie's Chest that I know she's enjoyed having input on. As you go through your process this project space enables you to take pictures of your sketches and designs and upload them to the 'repository' of designs and images for each project. I will go through below on how you can use this space, and we can work together to help you use it. The first project I put on that space for you and I together is a Workshop Project Board, a device I am going to help set up that we can hopeful hook into the central electrical line to enable you to pull this project space up on a tablet or handheld and reference while you work, without needing to do too much techy stuff, you'll just be able to tap the screen, drag stuff around, take the tablet off and snap and upload a pic, etc. This project space has it all, plenty to discuss and we have plenty of time to do it. The title of this project space is Progetti Di Pazienza, I think that means "Projects of Patience" in Italian, which I liked as a double entendre of our last name, and the general theme of doing projects as well as your patience precise nature with the projects. This space represents my intention for our relationship for this next decade of your life. You told me at least once when I was younger, dad, that your job wasn't to be my friend. It was to smack some sense into me and make sure I grow up to not be an idiot. I always thought you put it in a funny way, and I didn't dwell on it, I knew you loved me every step of the way, but looking back at that makes me feel really amazing. You are a great dad. You've been a great dad. I know that because I know in my heart who I am, and what I have got, and through that I know what a good job you did. I know what kind of man you are, because I have this fire insdie of me to have a boy someday, and be that man for him, and that I know is what you did, for that same fire. Anyways the end of your speach was always a promise to me dad. It was a promise that your job was to get me straightened out, but someday you really hoped we could become friends. I'd love for this birthday to represent a new chapter towards that end.<br>
          <br><br>So how this whole thing works is there are pages for the projects you work on, I made a template you can find to create a new project, and then there is a matching 'repository' space which houses the documents for each project. You can create "issues" for your project which is terminology we have in software that comes from the sense that there is some bug in your code, but it also represents new shit to do. So make some issues, break things down, request reviews from us kids, we can make it colaborative but there is also a good deal of stuff that you can just do for yourslef if you'd like. Check out Katie's Chest, I started a project for you on that and added the next task for you which is to glue the legs together. If its not too tedius for you, you can use that model for other tasks anywhere from the occasional thing you don't want to forget all the way to a full end to end project plan if you reall get into it. I mocked out some of the project steps you may need in one of the files in the main repository. The repository is where your physical documents live. Think of it like google drive, but much more centered on review and document accuracy, plus it integrates with the project board. You can make an 'issue' in the project board for Katie's Chest and link that issue to a change or creation of a doument in the katies-chest repository directory, and even have Katie review that change, which could involve a back and forth conversation and document review process, which I know Katie will love. She'll need to make an account through this website, Github, but its pretty easy, nd youll both get the hang of it. If this doesn't float your boat thats fine too, don't use it just for me, only use it if its helpful and fun. At the very least know that I am looking forward to 10 years of projects together, and I'm so proud to have you as my dad :)
          <br><br>Anyways, before I go uncle Barry on you, let me keep it short. To your 60th birthday dad. I love you so much. Heres to the next 10 years old timer,
          <br>Love Ben
