          Hey, Dad,<br>
          I've been trying to think of something to get you for your 60th. Trying didn't last long, I gave up after one trip downtown where I passed leather shops, cafes, fancy stationary stores, a store that's called "The Nut Shop" which just sells a bunch of nuts, fancy watch stores (that may have been cool), a suit place or two, you get the point. Nothing felt special enough for a 60th birthday. Its already hard enough to shop for you old timer. My whole life you have done everything you could for me and expected nothing in return. Thinking back to your past presents, I did give you, socks, sweaters, jerseys (I know that newcastle jersey was one of your favorites), slow cooked meat shredders shaped like wolverine's claws, whatever the hell else I am forgetting. None of those gifts ever seemed to matter to you as much as it did to see me thriving, see me happy, see me being myself and growing up strong and healthy and actually being a decent enough guy. So if all of those gifts fell short then how the hell am I supposed to know what to get you when I actually feel like enough is enough, you deserve the world in return and all I can think to get you within a reasonable budget is a watch or airpods or a suit. I only have a few decades left with you pops, I want us to make them count. I really do. Well im pretty good at writing, and listening to my emotions (albiet poorly or recklessly most of the time), something I have noticed you seem to have more of a focus on lately, so step one is this letter, from the heart. I hope you like it. Idk where I get it from but you can tell me sometime if you secretly are a letter writing savant. So this is just the introduction, strap in.<br>
          <br>
          I thought of a good gift. Here it is. The letter is the beginning as I just mentioned, but this letter represents what I'd like my gift to you today to be, and its a gift that keeps giving, which is definitely the best gift to give you since you'd "love" a watch but wear it fucking once or twice between now and when you turn 70 lol. My gift to you dad is a webpage. Its a project space for you to have a good time soaking up the slow meticulous process of being one of the most precise, intentional, and calm men I have ever met. I want you to use this project space to share the love you have for woodworking with the rest of us, its a place we can collaborate on projects for / with each other, an example being Katie's Chest that I know she's enjoyed having input on. As you go through your process this project space enables you to take pictures of your sketches and designs and upload them to the 'repository' of designs and images for each project. I will go through below on how you can use this space, and we can work together to help you use it. The first project I put on that space for you and I together is a Workshop Project Board, a device I am going to help set up that we can hopeful hook into the central electrical line to enable you to pull this project space up on a tablet or handheld and reference while you work, without needing to do too much techy stuff, you'll just be able to tap the screen, drag stuff around, take the tablet off and snap and upload a pic, etc. This project space has it all, plenty to discuss and we have plenty of time to do it.<br>
          <br>
          The title of this project space is Progetti Di Pazienza, I think that means "Projects of Patience" in Italian, which I liked as a double entendre of our last name, and the general theme of doing projects as well as your patience precise nature with the projects. This space represents my intention for our relationship for this next decade of your life. You told me at least once when I was younger dad, that your job wasn't to be my friend. It was to smack some sense into me and make sure I grow up to not be an idiot. I always thought you put it in a funny way, and I didn't dwell on it, I knew you loved me every step of the way, but looking back at that makes me feel really amazing. You are a great dad. You've been a great dad. I know that because I know in my heart who I am, and what I have got, and through that I know what a good job you did. I know what kind of man you are, because I have this fire insdie of me to have a boy someday, and be that man for him, and that I know is what you did, for that same fire. Anyways the end of your speach was always a promise to me dad. It was a promise that your job was to get me straightened out, but someday you really hoped we could become friends. Idk if you had some sense of a timeline on when we would be ready for that switch, but I have some thoughts. This gift is our next step. I don't care if we call it friendship, I don't think we need to, itll never be the same as what you would call a friend, like Scott Stadtler or Andrew Smith, but there are some differences between parenting and friendship that I think this project is going to be the most rewarding for us. Time spent together, even if to start you're still being my same old dad thats fine with me, but doing something together and colaborative, thats going to be a blast and I'm going to learn a ton from you, and I am going to teach you a thing or two if you chose to let me. On that note, vulnerability, the kind a parent can give but also just spending time together, having conversations in a way where its not about coming for help then going off into the world, but coming and staying, asking each other for help, being together, breaking down walls and differences. It might be harder for me, becaues right now I am hiding behind the safety of this screen instead of saying this all to your face, but thats the kind of thing im talking about when I say its going to be nice to see ourselves shift from parenting to friendship in these next 10 years. Anyways, before I go uncle Barry on you, I have to keep it short. <br>
          <br>This is your space, if you like it, thats great, if not, thats great too. This letter, the space, the time I spent doing this on February 8th 2025 2 hours before our dinner for your 60th birthday, its all just some simple words I said and time I spent. The important gift I am giving you today is an intention. So im going to watch you read this and hope you feel comfortable enough at the end to share that intention, to your 60th birthday dad. I love you so much. I am glad you're finally retiring, you've worked so hard and deserve the world, this change is going to bring good and bad, and I intend to be there to spend as much time with you as we both can comfortably handle in the decade to come, building shit, watching sports, travelling, drinking, eating, going on walks. <br>
          <br>
          So... friends? 

          Love,
          Ben
